| [[600 Coding/Security/Notes/profm - Security Controls\|profm - Security Controls]]   | In this section we learned about the different control types in security. These are Preventive, Deterrent, Detective, Corrective, Compensating, Directive. I placed these into my memory palace by using animal charachers. There is the Preventive Pigeons, the Deterrent Dodo Birds, the Detective Dragon, the Corrective Chameleon, Compensating Camel, and the Directive Duck. Each one of these controls have a differnt job to play. Preventive and deterrent happens before the attack while Detective and corrective happen after the attack. Compensating and directive are controls we can set up in the day to day. | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STM3EUvL7wg&list=PLG49S3nxzAnl4QDVqK-hOnoqcSKEIDDuv&index=3 | true          | \-           |

| [[600 Coding/Security/Notes/cybersec - Zero Trust\|cybersec - Zero Trust]]           | Zero Trust is when even after you log on to the system there is isn't trust on who you say you are. This is because if we trusted the user/device after they authenticated themselves then if a threat actor or malicious software got into the system they would have complete access. Therefore, at every step of the way we want to do some kind of check to make sure that that user/device is who it says it is.                                                                                                                                                                                                          | https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zC_Pndpg8-c&list=PLG49S3nxzAnl4QDVqK-hOnoqcSKEIDDuv&index=7 | \-            | true         |
