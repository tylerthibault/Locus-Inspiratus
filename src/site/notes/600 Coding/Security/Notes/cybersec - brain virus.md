# Notes
> [!definition] 
> **Brain Virus**
> - Discovered in **1986**, the Brain Virus holds the distinction of being the **first-ever PC virus**. It specifically targeted **IBM PC platforms** (and, by extension, the MS-DOS operating system).
> - What made Brain unique was its use of **stealth techniques** to hide its existence. It infected the **boot sector of floppy disks**.
> - Brain was created by two brothers from Pakistan, **Basit Farooq Alvi** and **Amjad Farooq Alvi**. They were running a computer store in Lahore when they noticed pirated copies of their own software being circulated by customers.
> - Their response? Enter Brain, also known as the **Pakistani Brain**. The virus included a message warning users about running bootleg software, along with the brothers’ names, phone numbers, and store address.
> - Interestingly, the Alvi brothers claimed that the virus was “not made to destroy any data.” Instead, it was intended to ensure that infected users could contact them for “vaccination” against the virus. [Little did they expect that the first phone call would come from the United States, and the virus would spread globally](https://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/11/05/malware-1980s-brain-virus-morris-worm/)
