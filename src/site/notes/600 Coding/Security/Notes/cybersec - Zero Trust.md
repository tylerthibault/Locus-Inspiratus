This is because if we trusted the user/device after they authenticated themselves then if a threat actor or malicious software got into the system they would have complete access. Therefore, at every step of the way we want to do some kind of check to make sure that that user/device is who it says it is.","YouTube_Link":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zC_Pndpg8-c&list=PLG49S3nxzAnl4QDVqK-hOnoqcSKEIDDuv&index=7","needs_review":true,"permalink":"/600-coding/security/notes/cybersec-zero-trust/","dgPassFrontmatter":true}
