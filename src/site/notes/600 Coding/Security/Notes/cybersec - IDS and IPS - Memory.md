> [!memory] 
> **Position 3**
> Two people standing around my dresser. One named Det and one named Prev. 
> Det is looking at a paper with a magnifying glass and slowing starting to say louder and louder "Hey, I found something" but ultimately he does nothing other that speak. 
> Prev on the other hand is doing the same thing but also has a lighter next to the thing he has found ready to destroy it. Also a guy that has fallen from the sky and crashed through the roof and is now an intruder in my house.
