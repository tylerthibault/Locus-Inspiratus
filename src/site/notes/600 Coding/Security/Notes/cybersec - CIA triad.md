## CIA Triad

**CIA** stands for **Confidentiality, Integrity,** and **Availability. CIA** is a model that is designed to guide policies for Information Security. It is one of the most popular models used by organizations.

**Confidentiality**

Only authorized users can access specific assets or data #google-cyber

The information should be accessible and readable only to authorized personnel. It should not be accessible by unauthorized personnel. The information should be strongly encrypted just in case someone uses hacking to access the data so that even if the data is accessed, it is not readable or understandable. #edureka

**Integrity**

Data is correct, authentic and reliable #google-cyber 

Making sure the data has not been modified by an unauthorized entity. Integrity ensures that data is not corrupted or modified by unauthorized personnel. If an authorized individual/system is trying to modify the data and the modification wasn’t successful, then the data should be reversed back and should not be corrupted. #ed

**Availability**

Data is accessible to those who are authorized to access it #google-cyber 

The data should be available to the user whenever the user requires it. Maintaining of Hardware, upgrading regularly, Data Backups and Recovery, Network Bottlenecks should be taken care of. #edureka

> Three CIA agents standing at the door leaving the bedroom.

> **The first CIA agent** has a gag tied around him so that he cannot talk, however, he doesn't seem to mind and stand stoutly in a parade rest with sunglasses on in his black suit. 
> 
> **The second CIA** agent is also in the classic CIA black suit but is actually Green Lantern and his hands are glowing green giving off a light that keeps them on the right path.
> 
**The third CIA Agent** is a woman who is making herself "available" to whoever come her way.
