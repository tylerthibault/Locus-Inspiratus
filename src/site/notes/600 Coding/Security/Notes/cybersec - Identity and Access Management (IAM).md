# Notes
> [!definition] 
> Keeps data secure, by ensuring users follow established policies to control and manage physical assets, like office spaces, and logical assets, such as networks and applications

As an entry-level analyst, it's essential to keep an organization's systems and data as secure as possible by *ensuring user access is limited to what employees need*. Basically, the goal of IAM is to **reduce the overall risk to systems and data.**

IAM uses the [[600 Coding/Security/Notes/cybersec - principle of least privilege\|cybersec - principle of least privilege]]
which is the concept of granting only the minimal access and authorization required to complete a task. As an example, a cybersecurity analyst might be asked to ensure that customer service representatives can only view the private data of a customer, such as their phone number, while working to resolve the customer's issue; then remove access when the customer's issue is resolved.

## 4 Main components
1. Identification
	   Identification is when a user verifies who they are by providing a user name, an access card or biometric data such as a fingerprint. 
2. Authentication
	   Authentication is the verification process to prove a person's identity, such as entering a password or PIN
3.  Authorization
	   Authorization takes place after a user's identity has been confirmed and relates to their level of access.
4.  Accountability
	   Accountability refers to monitoring and recording user actions, like login attempts, to prove systems and data are used properly.
