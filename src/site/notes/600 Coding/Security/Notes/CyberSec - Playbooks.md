# Notes

> [!memory] 
> A big football in the corner standing on its end, reading a magazine. Peering around the edgeof the magazine I see a bunch of plays and instructions. One one page there is a guy in CHAINS of he has a sign that says CUSTODY of the people. On the other page there is A policemanthat is protecting and preserving evidence at a bakery by adding preservatives into the mix. Atthe bottom of the 2nd page they have a picture of a pink elephant with the caption saying "Please Don't Call Elephants Pink Cows".
