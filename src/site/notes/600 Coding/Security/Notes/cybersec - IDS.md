**IDS** is **Intrusion Detection System** and it only detects intrusions and the administrator has to take care of preventing the intrusion.
## IDS (Intrusion Detection System)
**HIDS(Host IDS)** and **NIDS(Network IDS)** are both Intrusion Detection System and work for the same purpose i.e., to detect the intrusions.

### HIDS - Host-based Intrusion Detection System
**HIDS** is set up on a particular host/device. It monitors the traffic of a particular device and suspicious system activities.

### NIDS - Network-based Intrusion Detection System
**NIDS** is set up on a network. It monitors traffic of all device of the network.

> This is a system that is placed on the door frame of my bathroom. If you were to go through the door it will detect you as a host for an alien goa'uld implant. This is a painful and intrusive process. As an arm flies down from the ceiling and makes an "x" cut in your stomach. The goa'uld is then implanted into you and carves out a "home" for itself in your inner being. From there is monitors everything about who you are.
