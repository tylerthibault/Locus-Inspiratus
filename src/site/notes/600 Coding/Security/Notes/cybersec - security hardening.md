> Security hardening is the process of strengthening a system to reduce its vulnerability and attack surface.

As part of security hardening, security analysts perform regular maintenance procedures to keep network devices and systems functioning securely and optimally. Security hardening can be conducted on any device or system that can be compromised, such as <mark class="hltr-yellow">hardware, operating systems, applications, computer networks, and databases</mark>. Physical security is also a part of security hardening. This may include securing a physical space with security cameras and security guards.

Some common types of hardening procedures include <mark class="hltr-yellow">software updates</mark>, also called patches, and <mark class="hltr-yellow">device application configuration changes</mark>. These updates and changes are done to increase security and fix security vulnerabilities on a network. <mark class="hltr-orange">An example of a security configuration change would be requiring longer passwords or more frequent password changes.</mark> This makes it harder for a malicious actor to gain login credentials. An example of a configuration check is updating the encryption standards for data that is stored in a database. Keeping encryption up to date makes it harder for malicious actors to access the database.

Other examples of security hardening include <mark class="hltr-yellow">removing or disabling unused applications and services</mark>, <mark class="hltr-yellow">disabling unused ports, and reducing access permissions across devices and network</mark>. <mark class="hltr-blue">Minimizing the number of applications, devices, ports, and access permissions makes network and device monitoring more efficient and reduces the overall attack surface</mark>, which is one of the best ways to secure an organization.

Another important strategy for security hardening is to <mark class="hltr-yellow">conduct regular penetration testing</mark>. A penetration test, also called a pen test, is a simulated attack that helps identify vulnerabilities in a system, network, website, application, and process. Penetration testers document their findings in a report. Depending on where the test fails, security teams can determine the type of security vulnerabilities that require fixing. Organizations can then review these vulnerabilities and come up with a plan to fix them.
