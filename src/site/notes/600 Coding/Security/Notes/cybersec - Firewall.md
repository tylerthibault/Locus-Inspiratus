# Notes
> [!definition] 
*Monitors and/or restricts incoming or outgoing traffic based on a specific set of security rules.*

A Firewall is a network security system set on the boundaries of the system/network that monitors and controls network traffic. Firewalls are mainly used to protect the system/network from viruses, worms, malware, etc. Firewalls can also be to prevent remote access and content filtering.
## Steps to set up a firewall
- [x] Study (@2024-01-24)
1. _Username/password:_ modify the default password for a firewall device
2. _Remote administration:_ Disable the feature of the remote administration
3. _Port forwarding:_ Configure appropriate port forwarding for certain applications to work properly, such as a web server or FTP server
4. _DHCP server:_ Installing a firewall on a network with an existing DHCP server will cause conflict unless the firewall’s DHCP is disabled
5. _Logging:_ To troubleshoot firewall issues or potential attacks, ensure that logging is enabled and understand how to view logs
6. _Policies:_ You should have solid security policies in place and make sure that the firewall is configured to enforce those policies.
