# Notes
> [!definition] 
> Packet sniffing is the practice of using software tools to observe data as it moves across a network. Malicious actors can use hardware or software tools to capture and inspect data in transit

Malicious packet sniffing can be prevented. Let's look at a few ways the network security professional can prevent these attacks. 
1. One way to protect against malicious packet sniffing is to <mark class="hltr-yellow">use a VPN</mark> to encrypt and protect data as it travels across the network. If you don't remember how VPNs work, you can revisit the video about this topic in the previous section of the program. When you use a VPN, hackers might interfere with your traffic, but they won't be able to decode it to read it and read your private information. 
2. Another way to add a layer of protection against packet sniffing is to <mark class="hltr-yellow">make sure that websites you have use HTTPS</mark> at the beginning of the domain address. Previously, we discussed how HTTPS uses SSL/TLS to encrypt data and prevent eavesdropping when malicious actors spy on network transmissions. 
3. One final way to help protect yourself against malicious packet sniffing is to <mark class="hltr-yellow">avoid using unprotected WiFi</mark>. You usually find unprotected WiFi in public places like coffee shops, restaurants, or airports. These networks don't use encryption. This means that anyone on the network can access all of the data traveling to and from your device. One precaution you can take is avoiding free public WiFi unless you have a VPN service already installed on your device.
