> Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)


Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application layer protocol that provides a method of communication between clients and website servers. **HTTP uses port 80**. HTTP is considered insecure, so it is being replaced on most websites by a secure version, called [[600 Coding/Security/Notes/cybersec - HTTPS\|HTTPS]]. However, there are still many websites that use the insecure HTTP protocol. In the TCP/IP model, HTTP occurs at the application layer.
