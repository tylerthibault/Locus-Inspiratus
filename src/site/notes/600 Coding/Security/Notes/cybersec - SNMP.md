> Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)


Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a network protocol used for *monitoring and managing devices on a network*. SNMP can reset a password on a network device or change its baseline configuration. It can also send requests to network devices for a report on how much of the networkâ€™s bandwidth is being used up. In the TCP/IP model, SNMP occurs at the **application layer**.
