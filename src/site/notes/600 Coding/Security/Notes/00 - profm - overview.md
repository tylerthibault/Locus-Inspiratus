# Summary
> [!summary] 
> This section is is focused on getting the Security Plus Certification. I will be focusing on Professor Messer's YouTube videos, however I have already done some work in Coursera with the Google Cert Program. I will be using mnemonic devices to focus my retention and be primarily using the method of Loci to contain the data.

| [[600 Coding/Security/Notes/profm - Security Controls\|Security Controls]] | [Link Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STM3EUvL7wg&list=PLG49S3nxzAnl4QDVqK-hOnoqcSKEIDDuv&index=3) | In this section we learned about the different control types in security. These are Preventive, Deterrent, Detective, Corrective, Compensating, Directive. I placed these into my memory palace by using animal charachers. There is the Preventive Pigeons, the Deterrent Dodo Birds, the Detective Dragon, the Corrective Chameleon, Compensating Camel, and the Directive Duck. Each one of these controls have a differnt job to play. Preventive and deterrent happens before the attack while Detective and corrective happen after the attack. Compensating and directive are controls we can set up in the day to day. |   |

Confidentiality mean that only authorized users can access it. Integrity means that the info that we put in the container has not been tampered with. And Availability means that the data is ready to go when the authorized user wants to access it. |   |

This can be done using a public and private key to encrypt the hash of the content. |  |
| [[600 Coding/Security/Notes/cybersec - AAA Framework\|Authentication, Authorization and accounting]] | [Link Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhaZtj5P2a8) | This is the process of having a computer or user login to our system and be able to authenticate who they are and if they are allowed to be there. This also logs the data traffic that the user uses.  |  |
| [[600 Coding/Security/Notes/cybersec - gap analysis\|Gap Analysis]] | [Link Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cuTVyyS5C7M) | The gap analysis is the process of looking at where we are currently and where we want to be and making a plan to get there. This could includes looking at personnel as well as IT systems and physical security systems.  |  |
