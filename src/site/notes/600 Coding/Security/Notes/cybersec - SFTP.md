> Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP)


Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) is a secure protocol *used to transfer files from one device to another over a network*. SFTP *uses secure shell ([[600 Coding/Security/Notes/cybersec - SSH\|SSH]]),* typically through TCP port 22. SSH uses Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and other types of encryption to ensure that unintended recipients cannot intercept the transmissions. In the TCP/IP model, SFTP occurs at the **application layer**. 

SFTP is used often with cloud storage. Every time a user uploads or downloads a file from cloud storage, the file is transferred using the SFTP protocol.
