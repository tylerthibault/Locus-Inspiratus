> Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS)


Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (HTTPS) is a network protocol that *provides a secure method of communication between clients and website servers*. HTTPS is a secure version of [[600 Coding/Security/Notes/cybersec - HTTP\|HTTP]] that uses secure sockets layer/transport layer security (SSL/TLS) encryption on all transmissions so that malicious actors cannot read the information contained. *HTTPS uses port 443*. In the TCP/IP model, HTTPS occurs at the **application layer**.
