> This is a system that is placed on the door frame of my bathroom. If you were to go through the door it will detect you as a host for an alien goa'uld implant. This is a painful and intrusive process. As an arm flies down from the ceiling and makes an "x" cut in your stomach. The goa'uld is then implanted into you and carves out a "home" for itself in your inner being. From there is monitors everything about who you are.
