# Notes

> Cyber Threat Framework

According to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the CTF was developed by the U.S. government to provide “*a common language for describing and communicating information* about cyber threat activity.” By providing a common language to communicate information about threat activity, the CTF helps cybersecurity professionals analyze and share information more efficiently. This allows organizations to improve their response to the constantly evolving cybersecurity landscape and threat actors' many tactics and techniques.

# Notes

> An internationally recognized and used framework is ISO/IEC 27001. The ISO 27000 family of standards enables organizations of all sectors and sizes to manage the security of assets, such as financial information, intellectual property, employee data, and information entrusted to third parties. This framework outlines requirements for an information security management system, best practices, and controls that support an organization’s ability to manage risks. Although the ISO/IEC 27001 framework does not require the use of specific controls, it does provide a collection of controls that organizations can use to improve their security posture.

- [ ] #task #memory-work  CSF Functions

## Functions
1. Identify
	1. The management of cybersecurity risk and its effect on an organization's people and assets 
2. Protect
	1. The strategy used to protect an organization through the implementation of policies, procedures, training and tools that help mitigate cybersecurity threats
3. Detect
	1. Identifying potential security incidents and improving monitoring capabilities to increase the speed and efficiency of detections
4. Respond
	1. Making sure that the proper procedures are used to contain, neutralize and analyze security incidents, and implement improvements to the security process
5. Recover
	1. The process of returning affected systems back to normal operations

### Security Audits
#### External 

#### Internal
**Purpose**: Help improve an orgs security posture and help avoid fines from governing agencies. The help *id risk*, *assess controls* and *correct compliance issues*

 
- Conducted by a team of people
	- org compliance officer
	- security manager
	- security team members

##### Questions to ask
- What is the audit meant to achieve?
- Which assets are most at risk?
- Are current controls sufficient to protect those assets?
	- If not what controls and compliance regulations need to be implemented?
##### Common Elements
- [ ] #task #memory-work  know the different elements of an Internal security audit
- establishing scope and goals [[600 Coding/Security/Notes/cybersec - security audits - scope and goals\|here]]
- Conducting a risk assessment  [[600 Coding/Security/Notes/cybersec - security audits - risk assessment\|here]]
- Completing a controls assessment [[600 Coding/Security/Notes/cybersec - security audits - controls assessment\|here]]
- Assessing compliance [[600 Coding/Security/Notes/cybersec - compliance regulations\|here]]
- communicating results to stakeholders

![[Control categories.pdf]]


#### Audit Checklist
It’s necessary to create an audit checklist before conducting an audit. A checklist is generally made up of the following areas of focus:

**Identify the scope of the audit**

- The audit should:
    
    - List assets that will be assessed (e.g., firewalls are configured correctly, PII is secure, physical assets are locked, etc.) 
        
    - Note how the audit will help the organization achieve its desired goals
        
    - Indicate how often an audit should be performed
        
    - Include an evaluation of organizational policies, protocols, and procedures to make sure they are working as intended and being implemented by employees
        

**Complete a risk assessment**

- A risk assessment is used to evaluate identified organizational risks related to budget, controls, internal processes, and external standards (i.e., regulations).
    

**Conduct the audit**

- When conducting an internal audit, you will assess the security of the identified assets listed in the audit scope.
    

**Create a mitigation plan**

- A mitigation plan is a strategy established to lower the level of risk and potential costs, penalties, or other issues that can negatively affect the organization’s security posture. 
    

**Communicate results to stakeholders**

- The end result of this process is providing a detailed report of 
	- findings, 
	- suggested improvements needed to lower the organization's level of risk,
	- compliance regulations and standards the organization needs to adhere to.
