# Notes
> [!definition] 
> Transmission Control Protocol
> An internet communication protocol that allows two devices to form a connection and stream data

TCP/IP has 4 layers
1. Network access layer
	Hubs, modems, cables and wiring are all considered part of this layer. ARP is part of this layer as well. 
2. Internet layer
	Is responsible for ensuring the delivery to the destination host, which potentially resides on a different network.
3. Transport Layer
	   The transport layer is responsible for delivering data between two systems
4. Application Layer
	   The application layer is responsible for making network requests or responding to requests. Similar to the OSI model. Some common protocols used on this layer are:Â 
	- Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP)
	- Simple mail transfer protocol (SMTP)
	- Secure shell (SSH)
	- File transfer protocol (FTP)
	- Domain name system (DNS)
