> [!definition] 
> UDP stands for User Datagram Protocol. It is one of the core protocols of the Internet Protocol (IP) suite. *UDP is a connectionless and lightweight protocol* used for *data transmission in computer networks*. Unlike TCP, UDP does not establish a connection before sending data and *does not guarantee data delivery or order*. It is commonly used for services where a slight loss of data is acceptable, such as video streaming, DNS (Domain Name System), and some online games.

User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a connectionless protocol that *does not establish a connection between devices before a transmission*. This makes it less reliable than TCP. But it also means that it works well for transmissions that need to get to their destination quickly. For example, one use of UDP is for internet gaming transmissions. In the TCP/IP model, UDP occurs at the **transport layer**.
