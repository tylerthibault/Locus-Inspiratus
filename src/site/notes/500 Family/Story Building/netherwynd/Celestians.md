# About
The Celestians, an exceedingly rare race of Sky Dwellers, were known for their ethereal beauty and their close connection to the sky. While the Celestians themselves are long gone, their legacy endures through their descendants. These villagers, touched by their celestial lineage, continue to live in Netherwynd, their unique abilities passed down through generations.

# Backstory
The descendants of the Celestians are believed to carry the bloodline of the ancient skyward explorers. Over time, they developed unique abilities, allowing them to navigate the skies and harness the power of the elements. While the Celestians themselves ascended to the heavens, their descendants remain grounded, living ordinary lives in the realm below, with occasional manifestations of their celestial heritage.

# Building Guide
The Celestians, being sky dwellers, would have buildings that reflect an affinity for the sky and aerial elements:

1. **Elevated Structures:** Buildings should be on elevated platforms or floating islands high above the ground. Use materials like quartz, glass, and lighter wood types to create a sense of lightness.
    
2. **Airy Architecture:** Design structures with open spaces, high ceilings, and plenty of windows to let in light. Balconies and terraces would be common, providing views of the sky and land below.
    
3. **Light and Reflective Materials:** Utilize materials that have a lighter color palette or are reflective, such as white wool, glass, and light-colored woods, to represent the ethereal nature of the Celestians.
    
4. **Advanced Technology:** Given their skyward location, use elements that suggest advanced technology, such as redstone mechanisms for elevators or flying machines.
    
5. **Sky Gardens:** Include gardens with flowers and trees on terraces and rooftops, perhaps even using the End Rods for a mystical glow.
    
6. **Cloud-like Aesthetics:** Create cloud-like structures using white wool or glass to reinforce the sky theme.
    
7. **Wind and Sun Motifs:** Decorate with banners or paintings that feature sun, wind, or sky motifs, emphasizing their connection to the aerial elements.
    
8. **Observatories:** Include observatories or lookout points with telescopes made from End Rods and black stained glass for stargazing.
