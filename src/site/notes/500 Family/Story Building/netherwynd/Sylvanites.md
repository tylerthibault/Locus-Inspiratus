# About
The Sylvanites were the Surface Dwellers of Netherwynd, an ancient race known for their deep connection to the land's surface and its lush forests. Today, their descendants continue to thrive, carrying on the legacy of their forebears. These villagers live close to the surface and have inherited their ancestors' love for nature, often residing amidst the trees and maintaining a harmonious relationship with the natural world.
# Backstory
The descendants of the Sylvanites have a rich history rooted in the forests of Netherwynd. Once nomadic tribes, they settled into the woods and cultivated a profound understanding of the land's resources. Facing challenges from other races, they united under a wise and compassionate leader. Over generations, they built thriving communities in the heart of the forest, where they still live today, honoring their ancestors' heritage.



# Building Guide
1. **Natural Materials:** Sylvanite buildings should primarily use materials that blend seamlessly with the forest. Wood (such as oak, spruce, birch, or jungle wood) and leaves would be primary construction materials. You might also incorporate logs, wooden planks, fences, and doors.
    
2. **Tree-Based Structures:** Given their deep connection with trees, Sylvanites might build their homes in and around trees. Treehouses or platforms nestled in the canopy can be a common feature, interconnected by bridges or walkways.
    
3. **Greenery and Gardens:** Incorporate lots of greenery, like leaves, vines, and flower pots. Rooftop and hanging gardens can add a touch of nature to every building. Mossy cobblestones and mossy stone bricks can also be used for an overgrown, natural look.
    
4. **Organic Architecture:** Sylvanite buildings should have an organic, flowing design, avoiding rigid, straight lines where possible. The structures might follow the natural curves of the landscape or the trees they are built around.
    
5. **Lighting:** Use subtle and natural lighting. Lanterns and torches can be hidden among leaves to give a gentle, natural glow. Avoiding anything too bright or artificial helps maintain the mystical forest ambiance.
    
6. **Water Features:** Small streams or waterfalls can be integrated into their architecture, reflecting their harmony with all natural elements. Using water buckets, you can create flowing water features that add to the tranquility of their dwellings.
    
7. **Cultural Details:** Add elements that reflect Sylvanite culture, like crafting tables and furnaces hidden in natural enclosures, paintings of forest scenes, and wooden sculptures or totems.
    
8. **Integration with Environment:** Instead of clearing large areas for buildings, Sylvanite structures should look like a part of the forest, seamlessly integrated with the surrounding environment. This could mean building around existing trees and terrain rather than replacing them.
