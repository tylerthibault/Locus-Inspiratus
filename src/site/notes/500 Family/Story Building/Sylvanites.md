# About
The Sylvanites were the Surface Dwellers of Netherwynd, an ancient race known for their deep connection to the land's surface and its lush forests. Today, their descendants continue to thrive, carrying on the legacy of their forebears. These villagers live close to the surface and have inherited their ancestors' love for nature, often residing amidst the trees and maintaining a harmonious relationship with the natural world.
# Backstory
The descendants of the Sylvanites have a rich history rooted in the forests of Netherwynd. Once nomadic tribes, they settled into the woods and cultivated a profound understanding of the land's resources. Facing challenges from other races, they united under a wise and compassionate leader. Over generations, they built thriving communities in the heart of the forest, where they still live today, honoring their ancestors' heritage.
