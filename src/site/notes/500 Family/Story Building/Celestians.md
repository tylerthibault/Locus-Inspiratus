# About
The Celestians, an exceedingly rare race of Sky Dwellers, were known for their ethereal beauty and their close connection to the sky. While the Celestians themselves are long gone, their legacy endures through their descendants. These villagers, touched by their celestial lineage, continue to live in Netherwynd, their unique abilities passed down through generations.

# Backstory
The descendants of the Celestians are believed to carry the bloodline of the ancient skyward explorers. Over time, they developed unique abilities, allowing them to navigate the skies and harness the power of the elements. While the Celestians themselves ascended to the heavens, their descendants remain grounded, living ordinary lives in the realm below, with occasional manifestations of their celestial heritage.
